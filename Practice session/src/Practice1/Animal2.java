//Inheritance represents the IS-A Relationship which is also known as parent child relationship
//It is inheriting the properties of Parent class(Super class) into child class
//ADVANTAGES-- 1)Code Reusability 2)We can achieve polymorphism using Inheritance
//DISADVANTAGES--1)Class is Tightly coupled
//FIVE types of Inheritance--1)Single 2)Multilevel 3)Hierarical 4)multiple 5)Hybrid
//Constructor is not part of class-we can't inherit this
//can't inherit private
//inheritance is achieved by extends keyword
//Every class has a super or say parent class but object class does not have any parent class
