//Interface
//There are no method body,thats why we can't create any object
//this are blueprint of the class.it specify what a class must do & not how
//Uses-1)used to achieve abstractor 2)it supports multiple inheritance 3)used to achieve loose coupling
//Interface methods are by default public& abstract
//interface variables are by default public static+final
//interface method must be overridden inside the implementing classes
//Interface nothing but deals between client & developer
